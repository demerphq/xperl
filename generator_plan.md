# Trial generators using one-shot continuations

Working branch: `yves/fork_sub`.

This plan was restored during a completion audit because the previous removal
was not supported by sufficient evidence.

## Audit status

- [x] Process snapshots, opcode-boundary hooks, and private stack ownership
- [x] Generator syntax, one-shot resume protocol, and explicit `generator_yield`
- [x] Nested eval, failure propagation, exhaustion, and re-entrancy
- [x] Feature/compiler diagnostics and documentation metadata
- [x] DEBUGGING and sanitizer validation
- [x] Destruction, GC, callback-context, and scheduler edge-case coverage
- [x] Final full relevant validation and cleanup

The DEBUGGING threaded build passes the focused generator, eval, loop, and
thread tests.  An isolated ASAN/DEBUGGING threaded build also passes the
generator and threaded smoke paths.  The agent sandbox cannot run
LeakSanitizer because it is ptrace-restricted, so the full generator test was
also run from the host terminal with `PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2`: all 46 tests
passed, and the direct generator smoke produced no leak report.  That full
test process still reports the two documented DEBUGGING temporary-SV teardown
diagnostics and a 176-byte indirect allocation retained by the test-process
teardown; neither reproduces in the direct generator smoke.  Cleanup coverage
includes dropping a suspended generator with a lexical object, callback
diagnostics, process-state round trips, and deterministic quantum-one
scheduler alternation.

The final scoped native harness passes all five relevant files (274 tests),
and the XS scheduler test passes all three checks.  The DEBUGGING generator
test still reports two non-fatal temporary-SV teardown diagnostics; minimal
runtime reproductions do not reproduce them, so they remain documented as a
test-harness teardown limitation rather than suppressed.

The process-local `PL_*` fields remain field-by-field snapshots.  Keep the
follow-up investigation for a contiguous execution record that could be
copied or swapped through one assignment, subject to ABI, threading, and GC
constraints.

The experimental generator trio is now `generator_create`, `generator_yield`,
and `generator_exhausted`.  `generator_exhausted` is a non-advancing predicate:
it is true only after the generator completes, and false for new, suspended,
and failed generators.
The final DEBUGGING `make_test` run completed 2,947 files and 1,398,115 tests.
All generator tests passed.  Its diagnostic failures were the four generator
messages added after that run began; a subsequent standalone diagnostic check
confirmed those messages are documented.  The only remaining version-check
notice is the generated `B::Op_private` file, whose version is tied to the
unchanged core Perl version.

Follow-up: consider blessing the callable generator CODE reference into an
`generator::Instance` class implemented in Perl, providing convenience methods
such as `next()` and `exhausted()` to callers that do not enable the generator
feature.  This should preserve the primitive callable protocol.

## Execution-context indirection follow-up

The current `PERL_PROCESS_STATE` is a field-by-field snapshot in `run.c`.
That is correct for the existing trial implementation, but it makes every
generator switch copy the same group of interpreter variables.  Investigate a
generated execution-context record so a switch can install one pointer rather
than copying those values.

### Design constraints established during investigation

- `intrpvar.h` is a multi-purpose input.  It generates the threaded
  `struct interpreter`, the unthreaded global declarations, initialization
  code, the handshake layout, exports, and `embedvar.h` access macros.  Any
  annotation must therefore have defined behavior in every one of those
  passes; it cannot be an ordinary C declaration added to only one pass.
- Existing interpreter members cannot simply be removed or reordered.  The
  interpreter-size handshake and embedding compatibility depend on the
  historical prefix and on new members being appended.  The first safe design
  should append an active-context pointer and retain legacy storage unless an
  explicit compatibility decision permits an ABI change.
- In a threaded/multiplicity build, the active pointer belongs in the
  interpreter object.  In an unthreaded build, it must be a global pointer.
  The `PL_*` access layer must resolve annotated variables through that pointer
  in both modes, while initialization and compatibility declarations continue
  to work.
- A generated context record should contain only execution-local state.  It
  must not contain `JMPENV` or other C-stack addresses, interpreter-wide
  allocators, global hooks, or state whose ownership/GC rules are not local to
  the suspended execution.  Exception environments continue to be created
  for each generator invocation.

### Proposed implementation shape

1. Introduce an annotation macro, tentatively `PERLVARCTX`, beside the
   existing `PERLVAR` family.  Mark the variables currently listed in
   `PERL_PROCESS_STATE`, after auditing omissions and variables that must stay
   interpreter-wide.
2. Add a generated `perl_execution_context` structure using the same annotated
   declarations.  Generate it from `intrpvar.h` so field names and types have
   one source of truth; do not hand-maintain a second list in `run.c`.
3. Add an active-context pointer to the interpreter/global state.  Generate
   `PL_*` accessors for annotated variables so threaded and unthreaded builds
   both dereference the active pointer.  Arrange declaration order so the
   unthreaded compatibility declarations do not collide with those macros.
4. Make `PERL_PROCESS_STATE` either contain, or point at, the generated record
   and change save/restore to install the pointer.  Keep an explicit slow
   compatibility path while validating the generated layout and nested
   generator behavior.
5. Audit cloning (`perl_clone`), interpreter initialization/destruction,
   debugger/runops wrappers, `PERL_RC_STACK`, regex execution, and embedding
   headers before enabling the pointer path by default.
6. Add a debug-only consistency check comparing the generated context fields
   against the legacy fields during the transition, then remove the duplicate
   copying only after DEBUGGING, threaded, sanitizer, and full `make_test`
   runs pass.

### State classification to audit

The first candidate set is `op`, `curcop`, `comppad`, `curpad`, the active
stack pointers and stackinfo, the mark/save/scope/temporary stacks, `curpm`,
`curpm_under`, `reg_curpm`, `multideref_pc`, `defgv`, `curstash`, `curcopdb`,
taint flags, `delaymagic`, `dowarn`, `in_eval`, `localizing`, and `restartop`.
The audit must explicitly consider `regmatch_state`, debugger state, current
context-stack ownership, `PL_restartjmpenv`, and runops boundary hooks before
classifying them as swappable.  `top_env`, `start_env`, and `JMPENV` objects
remain excluded.

### Validation gates

- First validate generated declarations and offsets in both multiplicity and
  non-multiplicity builds without changing runtime behavior.
- Then benchmark and test process-state switching, nested generators, eval and
  exception paths, callbacks, destruction, DEBUGGING, threaded, and ASAN
  builds.
- Run `make_test` in tmux window 3 at the end of each implementation phase.

## Parameterized generator continuation work

- [x] Preserve initial invocation arguments for normal `@_` and signature binding
- [x] Return resume arguments from `generator_yield` with Perl context semantics
- [x] Preserve zero, one, and many yielded values, including `yield ()`
- [x] Preserve explicit list-valued returns on exhaustion
- [x] Accept generator signatures in `generator_create (...) { ... }`
- [x] Add focused regression coverage, diagnostics, and documentation
- [ ] Run the relevant DEBUGGING, threaded, sanitizer, and `make_test` validation
